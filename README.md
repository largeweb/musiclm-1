# MusicLM: Generating Rap Instrumentals from Text Prompts

This project aims to implement an end-to-end MusicLM model to generate rap instrumentals from text prompts. MuLaN, a jointly trained text-audio embedding model, learns a shared embedding space, while the AudioLM model generates audio sequences conditioned on MuLaN embeddings.

## Steps

1. **Dataset Preparation:** Collect 1000 rap instrumental audio clips and their corresponding text captions from YouTube. Convert the audio clips into wav files and preprocess them as required.
2. **MuLaN Model Training:** Adapt and train the MuLaN model on the dataset to create a joint embedding space for audio and text.
3. **Conditioning AudioLM:** Use the `MuLaNEmbedQuantizer` class to generate conditioning embeddings for the semantic, coarse, and fine transformers of the AudioLM model.
4. **Transforming AudioLM:** Train the semantic, coarse, and fine transformers of AudioLM, and modify AudioLM to accept conditioning embeddings for music generation.
5. **Integrating MusicLM:** Create and use the MusicLM model with the trained AudioLM and MuLaNEmbedQuantizer to generate rap instrumentals from text prompts.
6. **Model Fine-tuning:** Monitor MusicLM's performance and fine-tune the models for improved quality and consistency of generated music.
7. **Project Documentation:** Keep the README.md updated and create documentation to help the team understand project details, dataset, models, training procedures, challenges faced, and instructions for future development.
8. **Testing and Analysis:** Extensively test and evaluate the generated music using appropriate metrics, comparing results with existing baselines.
9. **Collaboration and Code Reviews:** Encourage team communication, collaboration, and code reviews to improve code quality and ensure smooth project progression.
10. **Future Work:** Identify areas of improvement, potential features, and extensions, incorporating them into the project roadmap and implementing as necessary.

## Next Steps

1. **Dataset Expansion:** Increase the dataset size by collecting more audio clips and text captions for training.
2. **Model Capacity Growth:** Experiment with larger model architectures by increasing dimensions, heads, and layers for MuLaN and transformers.
3. **Longer Training and Fine-tuning:** Train models for more epochs, adapt learning rates, and save checkpoint models frequently for better results.
4. **Additional Conditioning Inputs:** Explore conditioning on other signals like melody along with text for enhancing music generation capabilities.
5. **Interactive Demo:** Develop an interactive demonstration where users can generate samples and evaluate the model's performance.
6. **Improving Diversity and Coherence:** Implement techniques to balance the dataset and improve the diversity, quality, and coherence of generated music.
